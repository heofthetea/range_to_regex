# range_to_regex
Python script to transform a range of integers [n, m] into a regular expression matching all numbers within this range in decimal notation.

## The algorithm used
For now I provided a quick overview over the algorithm's work in `range_to_regex.py`. I'll (maybe) write a bit more about it here.



## Usage of the test script
run
```bash
python canonical_test.py -h
```
